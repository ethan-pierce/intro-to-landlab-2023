This workshop is intended as an introduction to the Landlab framework. It consists
of four notebooks, each of which covers a different topic within Landlab:
1. Introduction to Landlab grids
2. Importing data into Landlab
3. Fields and grid connectivity
4. A simple diffusion model
Each notebook also has an accompanying notebook with answers, if you would prefer to
follow along without writing code during the workshop. If we have additional time at
the end of the clinic, we can also talk about how to use Landlab components and/or
how to contribute your own components to the Landlab ecosystem!

**Before running any notebooks, click the top right corner of your browser window,
where it says `Python 3`. In the drop-down menu, change this to `Ivy`.**

### Local installation

If you would like to run these notebooks on your personal computer, you can do
that too. You will need to have a Python installation (we recommend the
[Anaconda distribution][anaconda-download], but others should work as well).

If you have `git` installed, you can get the lessons by cloning this repository,

    git clone git@github.com:ethan-pierce/intro-to-landlab-2023

Once you have the source code, install the necessary dependencies to run the
notebooks into your current environment (either *pip* or *conda*/*mamba* should work),

    cd intro-to-landlab-2023
    conda create --name intro-to-landlab --file requirements.txt
